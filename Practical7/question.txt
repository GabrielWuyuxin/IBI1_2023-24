Question:Plot a boxplot of DALYs across countries in 2019, and discuss what it shows
Line number for the code starts: 36
The result:
During the plotting I discovered that it is difficult to draw boxplot of DALYs across countries in a single year of 2019,
and the boxplot can't express varies across countries,
so I changed it to scatter plot.
The DAPYs values vary widely between countries. Values of most countries are above 20000,
the biggest value is above 90000.
