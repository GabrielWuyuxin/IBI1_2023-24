# feedback from formative submission
- In Practical3 I have a file "thingsIlike-copy.txt" with a wrong name. In practicals for  summative submission I checked every fiel and script to ensure their names are correct. And I didn't include reflection file. In following practicals I include necessary reflection for each of them.
-   In Practical4 I have several mistakes. For the coding itself, I calculated a variable wrong, and didn't display all the numbers it should display. For comments I didn't explan a code right and didn't state the random numbers are between 1 and 10. For summative submission I check all the function for whether they can run normally, and add necessary statements and comments.
- In Practical6 my code was lack of a output of average time of activities and lack two sorted list of cities sizes. That was because I didn't read what I need to output carefully. In summative submission I check every "For your portfolio" to ensure nothing was missed.
